# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Python Project

A **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption program written in Python.  
This project was **developed by Abdulkadir Bingol**, based on concepts learned in *Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp* on Udemy.  
It demonstrates practical use of loops, functions, conditionals, and modular arithmetic to implement a classic cipher algorithm.

## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.  
It shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
For example, with a shift of 3:

plain text : abc xyz 
cipher text: def abc

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Run the program.  
2. Choose whether to **encode** or **decode** a message.  
3. Enter your message and a shift number.  
4. The program outputs the encrypted or decrypted result.  
5. Type `no` when you want to exit.

## 🧩 Example Output
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello world
Type the shift number:
5
Here is the encoded result: mjqqt btwqi

Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise, type 'no':
no
